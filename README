  How to Add Websites
  ```````````````````

    To add websites just send a pull request with your project.
    Each website is a plain old text file without an extension
    and contains meta information.  The format is as follows:

      Name: The name of your website
      URL: The URL of your website
      Source: Optionally the link to the sourcecode

      Optionally some textual description.  Double newlines
      are preserved as paragraph, regular newlines are
      normalized to whitespace.
