  How to Add Websites
  ```````````````````

    To add websites just send a pull request with your project.
    Each website is a plain old text file without an extension
    and contains meta information.  The format is as follows:

      Name: The name of your website
      URL: The URL of your website
      Source: Optionally the link to the sourcecode

      Optionally some textual description.  Double newlines
      are preserved as paragraph, regular newlines are
      normalized to whitespace.

  Screenshots and Cache Folder
  ````````````````````````````

    Do not modify the screenshots in the cache folder or the
    JSON file there.  There is a bot which monitors this repo
    and automatically updates the files in there.
